### Description:

The Temporary Mute workflow allows a user to mute the volume of their computer for a specified duration of time. Once the duration of time has elapsed, the computer's volume is automatically unmuted. The user can also manually unmute the volume at any time before the defined duration is over.

### Usage:

The workflow has two modes which can be used:

`mute for`: Using the "mute for" keyword phrase allows the computer to be muted for the exact number of seconds specified. Simply include a number after "mute for" and the volume will remain muted for that number of seconds. [Example: "mute for 90"]
